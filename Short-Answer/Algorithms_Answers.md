## Exercise I
a) O(2n)

b)O(n) => O(n^3)

c) O(n) or O(bunnies)

## Exercise II

Story(f)
if F < egg survives
elif F > egg break

Binary Search of all the stories to find F, if f/2 and the egg broke then split it agian into 4 diffent parts, until you get closer and closer to the part of f's where the egg does not break then divide and conqure agian and agian until you found the exact f where it breaks or does not break. This would be the least time consuming strategy as you would most likely start in the middle and go down the side of the building in halves. the time complexity would be O(log n)
